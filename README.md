## <a name="the-problem-i-wanted-to-solve">ðŸŽ¯ The Problem</a>

For my first web app project, I aimed to address a common issue among my college classmates. The class schedule we received was not organized or visualized in a way that provided a clear understanding of how our days looked like. I set out to create a simple program that allows users to create an account, record their class data, and visualize a clearer schedule.

To run this program, you need to have GlassFish up and working, along with startup connection environment variables for your database URL and password, etc.

## <a name="deployment">ðŸ“¦ Deployment</a>

After building the application, you are provided with a WAR file that can be used to deploy the project. I deployed this project on Amazon Web Services using an EC2 instance in the same VPC as my RDS. My EC2 was in a public subnet, and my RDS remained in a private subnet for secure data storage. I used SSH protocol to transfer the WAR file to my EC2 instance.
